# Visualiztions
These are my projects from QSS 17 (Data Visualization), a course at Dartmouth College. Each project focused on a different aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic and were written as pandemic data became publicly available in spring of 2020.
The repo contains R scripts and a pdf rendering of the output for each project.
