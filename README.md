# Visualiztions
These are my projects from QSS 17 (Data Visualization), a course at Dartmouth College. Each project focused on a different aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic and were written as pandemic data became publicly available in spring of 2020.
The repo contains R scripts and a pdf rendering of the output for each project.

## Project 1

This plot uses data from the [Pew Research Center: American Trends Panel Wave 64](https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/ipoll/study/31117262). It explores the relationship between opinion of how Donald Trump is "doing his "job" and two variables: Personal Financial Threat Posed by the COVID-19 Pandemic and Political Ideology. One point of note is that, while the proportion of respondents who chose "Strongly Disapprove" and "Strongly Approve" are about the same in the group for which COVID-19 does not pose a threat (left panel), the proportion who "Strongly Disapprove" is much greater than the proportion who "Strongly Approve" in the group for which COVID-19 poses a major threat. In other words, the financially stable seemed to favor Trump much more than the financially precarious during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Project 2

This plot uses data from [The Atlantic's COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/data/api). It simply shows the number of COVID-19 tests distributed in each state, faceted by geographic region (and arranged to approximate the physical location of these regions).

## Project 3

This plot uses data from this [time-series](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv) data about global COVID-19 deaths.
